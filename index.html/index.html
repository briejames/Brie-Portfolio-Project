    <h2>Current Interests</h2>
    <p>Currently my interests are coding and learning code, connecting with others about coding and networking. That's my main focus right now. Not much for anything else as when I focus on a goal I
        need to see it through before I can really focus on much else. I also love spending time with my family, reading Tarot, Traveling, going to see concerts, and going to the movies. </p>
