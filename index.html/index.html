    <h3> Experience</h3>

    <p>I come from a customer service background. I have been in the industry since the age of 16 so for twenty two years.
        I started out as a Hostess at a restaurant. Eventually working my way up to To-Go Server then Server while
        also working the back of house as well. I stayed at that job until I turned 21 and jumped into bartending. I was a bartender
        for almost 17 years and was at my last place of employment for 12 years, I now currently do the bookkeeping there. Bartending allowed me the time to essentially be a stay at home mom, al the while weaving in other tools and trades. I have experience in Public Relations, Social Media Marketing, Massage Therapy,
        Music Production, as well as being a Licensed Massage Therapist and Licensed Aesthetician. I've worked in every area of the service Industry from dive bars, night clubs, and strip clubs to event 
        production and a corporate setting.

    <h2>Current Interests</h2>
    <p>Currently my interests are coding and learning code, connecting with others about coding and networking. That's my main focus right now. Not much for anything else as when I focus on a goal I
        need to see it through before I can really focus on much else. I also love spending time with my family, reading Tarot, Traveling, going to see concerts, and going to the movies. </p>
